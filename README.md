# An attemp to create a terminal text editor
Followed `kilo` tutorial.

- `EditorLib`: contains some attemp to create a library? Interfaces to Editor's data structures.
- `Editor3`: I suppose 3 means the third attempt. Have some `Terminal` interface. Documented code. Looks cool, though it's not OOP. I followed `kilo` mostly.
- `Editor3WithoutTabs`: experiment to eliminate `real` and `render` parts of line representation. Probably, it works.
